- bash-completion and coreutils are necessary for Mac, but possibly not for
  other Unixes
  (In particular, coreutils includes base32/basenc, md5sum, shred, and timeout)
- Don't install gnupg on Mac if using GPG Suite
- ksh has been deprecated in favor of ksh93 for Brew (which still installs a ksh
  binary)
- texinfo is mainly for the info utility, which was removed in macOS starting
  with Ventura (macOS 13)
- Leave out some things that can be assumed to be present (and if there are
  packages for them, might override the system versions):
  awk sed grep tar less gzip ssh
